After a very busy day in which we released our first stable version, swiftly followed by a number of bugfixes, we are
proud to announce version `1.1.0` of the Eloquent Tables package.

This version adds a new feature: **Page styling**.

You see, when using our own package, we soon realized that the package not only renders a table. It also renders
buttons, search fields, pagination and filters. All of these should have a uniform style in line with the rest of the
table as well, so we added this functionality.

Visit the [documentation](http://bricknpc.github.io/eloquent-tables/docs/styling/page-styling) to find out how to use the new page styling.

Below are a few screenshots that show what a completely styled table looks like in one of our own projects:
