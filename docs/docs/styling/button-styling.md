# Button Styling

Button styles define the look and feel of actions (TableAction, MassAction, RowAction). They add styling to your buttons 
based on the current theme (for now only Bootstrap 5).

See the [table action](../actions/table-actions.md#styles), [mass action](../actions/mass-actions.md#styles) and 
[row action](../actions/row-actions.md#styles) documentation on how to apply them to each button type.
