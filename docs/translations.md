# Translations

BrickNPC Eloquent Tables are built with multi-language support. Just set the language in your Laravel app as usual, 
Eloquent Tables will automatically use the correct translation if it's available.

These languages are currently supported:

- English
- Dutch

Planned languages:

- German
- French

## Translation keys

If you want to use your own translations, you can add these translation keys to your translation files:

- `You are not authorized to view this table.`
- `Are you sure?`
- `Select all`
- `Cancel`
- `Yes, confirm`
- `Close`
- `To confirm this action, please type the text <code>:confirmValue</code> into the textbox below.`
- `Filter on :name`
